# Animal Family Backend
This is very much a work in progress right now. Let's call it a Pre-Alpha-Alpha. If you'd like to collab in any way, please reach out! Find my contact info on whitcodes.dev/contact

## To-Do List
- CreateAnimal
- CreateAnimalWithEnclosure
- CreateEnclosure
- CreateEnclosureWithAnimals

- Link Animal/Enclosure/User with joining tables (possibly as part of the previous creation endpoints)
    - This will also work for adding other users to your own animals and enclosures

- GetAnimalsAndEnclosuresByUserId
- GetAnimalsByUserId
- GetEnclosuresByUserId
- GetAnimalsByEnclosureId
- GetEnclosuresByAnimalId
