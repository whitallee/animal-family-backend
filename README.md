# Animal Family Backend
This is very much a work in progress right now. Let's call it a Pre-Alpha-Alpha. If you'd like to collab in any way, please reach out! Find my contact info on [whitcodes.dev/contact](whitcodes.dev/contact). If you'd like to check out my first prototype, I've got it hosted on Vercel currently at [this](animal-family.vercel.app) link. Also the text-notification functionality is down, but I'll be working on that once I have this new backend up and running.

## To-Do List
